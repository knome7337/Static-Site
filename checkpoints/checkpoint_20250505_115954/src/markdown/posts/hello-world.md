# Hello World

Welcome to my first blog post! This is a simple example of how to write content in Markdown.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world's most popular markup languages.

### Benefits of Markdown

1. Easy to read and write
2. Can be converted to HTML
3. Works well with version control
4. Supported by many platforms

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## Images

You can include images like this:
